Test types: 
    -E2E: No e2e tests needed, only api's and unit tests can ensure everything is ok w/ this service
    -Integration: 
        Focused on testing the service through API's
    -Contract testing:
        The firt scenario of each spec has more assertions on purpose. It's not only to validate it has data, 
        it ensures that all the fields were fetched; 
    -Unit:
        They were done at an API level, however mainly the error scenarios can run as unit tests, to test not valid 
        or missing inputs for example;

Test cases:
    They're written in Gherkin language above each .it block of testing;
    They cover different combination of inputs, missing inputs and forced error scenarios

Cypress: I've chosen cypress to do it because I have more experience w/ it. However, for api testing it's possible to create 
postman collections and run the job in a pipe w/ Newman, it's a good approach too.
